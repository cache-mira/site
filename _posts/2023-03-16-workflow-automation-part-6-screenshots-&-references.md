# Appendix A
_Screenshots of Docker Containers_
The two different operating systems run six containers: 
⦁	Agent for running commands
⦁	Web-client you access in the browser
⦁	Redis server for message brokering
⦁	MySQL database to hold the data
⦁	Keycloak authentication system
⦁	API server to interact with the platform.
